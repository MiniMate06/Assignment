		<strong><p>Welcome to the page</p></strong>
		
	<p>My name is Jacob Cole. Im a year 10 student at Kelso High Campus and I work hard to achieve positive results. I believe that when taking part in the workforce it is required that you have respect for those around you and the equipment you use, that effort should be installed in everything you do for success and that it is important to represent your workplace in the best way possible. I have played cricket in the past but I have always played the game of football (soccer) for Eglinton of which I had just recieved a 10 years of service reward for. I commonly play video games in my spare time or try to get out of the house for a run or with friends down town. Below is a list of ways you can contact me.
